# tech-foundation

A personal workspace for learning, practicing, and organizing core technical concepts
across programming, data, and intelligent systems.

## Why this repository exists

This repository is meant to hold my early and ongoing work as I build a solid
technical base. It helps keep learning structured instead of scattered.

The focus here is on understanding fundamentals clearly before moving on to
larger or more specialized projects.

---

## What you’ll find here

- Basic programming practice (mainly Python)
- Introductory data handling and analysis
- Early Machine Learning concepts
- AI fundamentals and small experiments
- Logical problem-solving and DSA basics
- Notes and simple implementations

## How this repository is used

This is a learning-first space.
Code may be simple, revised often, or replaced as concepts become clearer.
When something grows into a complete or focused project, it will move to its
own repository.

## Status

In active learning.
This repository reflects progress, not expertise.
